# Chiller

Chiller is an app that integrates Spotify with Youtube to create an audiovisual music experience.

I wanted to work on a project that I would practically use. To do so, I imagined the setting in which I would use such an app: when I am just sitting around in my room with some friends listening to music. To further create an atmosphere around the music, I decided to merge the music with their visuals.

## Starting the App

Simply double click on the "laucher.bat" file.
You may also run npm start

## Terminate the App

Chiller will still be running until the command prompts are closed.
If you just close the browser, you'll still be able to access the app through localhost:3000, until those command prompts are closed

## Future enhancements:

- Make standalone (i.e. out of browser)
- Desktop shortcut
- Openable without a command prompt
- Automatically close excess command prompts on app close
